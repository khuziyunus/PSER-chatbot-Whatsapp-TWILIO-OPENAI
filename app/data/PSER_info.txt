## *Chunk 1 — PSER: Purpose and Background (Self-Contained Context)*

The Punjab Socio-Economic Registry (PSER) is a province-wide socio-economic survey initiated by the Government of Punjab and overseen by the Planning & Development Board. It is designed as a door-to-door household survey covering all 41 districts of Punjab, the enumerator would come to the door step to get you registered into PSER. 
The primary goal of PSER is to create a unified, accurate, and continuously updated digital 
registry of household-level information, including demographics, income indicators, assets, 
and living conditions. This registry would help the government identify potential beneficiaries for the cash transfer programs with data-driven precision. This collected household data will be used as the foundation for provincial social protection programs, income support schemes, and disaster relief targeting. 
This is not for targeted subsidies rather just for welfare programs.
The survey will end on 31st december 2025.Please contact on our provided helpline 080002345 and an enumerator will be dispatched to your house.

## *Chunk 2 — Strategic Governance Structure of PSER*

PSER operates under a multi-agency governance framework. The Punjab Social Protection Authority (PSPA) serves as the lead agency responsible for operational execution, program design, and overall delivery. The Planning & Development Board provides high-level policy direction, resource allocation, and strategic oversight. Several technical and administrative partners support implementation:

* The Bureau of Statistics (BoS) trains the enumerators and tehsil monitors, supervises field data collection and looks after the quality of the survey (Quality Assurance).
* Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) manages digital systems, survey applications, secure data pipelines, and dashboards.
* The Urban Unit (UU) deploys enumerators in the field, assists with GIS layers, spatial mapping, and field logistics and management .
* District Administrations coordinate local teams, community engagement, and grievance handling.
* The Coordination Support Unit (CSU) provides cross-agency alignment and monitoring.
  This governance model ensures uniform standards across districts while maintaining operational flexibility at the field level.

## *Chunk 3 — Geographic and Operational Coverage*

PSER covers every district, tehsil, union council, village, and urban block of Punjab.
The implementation strategy relies on phased roll-outs to ensure quality, resource availability, 
and district-level readiness. Each field cycle involves area mapping, local notification campaigns,
enumerator deployment, and real-time monitoring dashboards. 
The objective is complete population coverage so that every household in Punjab is included in the socio-economic registry.

## *Chunk 4 — Hybrid Data Collection Model*

PSER uses a hybrid data collection model to ensure accuracy and reliability. The primary mode is Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) conducted during door-to-door visits. This is complemented by administrative datasets (where available) and community validation processes. Community validation includes "beta families" (trusted early respondents) and neighborhood profiling, where local notables confirm household information. This triangulated approach reduces fraud, improves trust, and ensures data consistency across regions. Each household record includes demographic details, household size, education levels, disability indicators, employment status, housing conditions, ownership of durable goods, and other socio-economic variables.

## *Chunk 5 — Enumerator Enablement and Field Workforce*

PSER is executed by a large trained workforce consisting of enumerators, supervisors, teachers, district coordinators, and tehsil monitors. Before each field wave, PSER runs intensive training programs covering: survey protocols, tablet usage, CAPI workflows, ethical guidelines, household approach methodology, privacy rules, and exception handling. Enumerators are trained to handle sensitive questions and maintain neutrality. Tehsil monitors conduct spot checks, monitor GPS accuracy, verify timestamps, and ensure data completeness. This multi-layer training ensures uniform quality across Punjab.

## *Chunk 6 — Public Awareness and Community Engagement*

To build trust and increase participation, PSER conducts large-scale awareness campaigns. These campaigns include radio announcements, television ads, newspaper features, social media posts, influencers and district notice boards. Communities are informed about the purpose of the PSER survey, its benefits, and its privacy protections. Residents are made aware through these communication campaigns of the progress, and how PSER data would help determine eligibility for government assistance programs involving cash transfers. Local influencers and community leaders also participate to verify legitimacy and reduce hesitancy among households.

 *chunk 7 - Registration
Being registered with PSER places you in the pool from which the government determines who qualifies for benefits. These benefits include all cash transfer programs, such as the Ramzan Nigehban Package and others.
If a PSER enumerator has visited your household with an official tablet and collected your information, you are already registered. However, if you would still like to verify your registration status, you may contact the PSER helpline at 0800-02345 for confirmation

## *Chunk 8 — Data Refresh and Life-Event Updates*

PSER is not a one-time survey. It is a dynamic registry with periodic data refresh cycles. Households can also request updates for major life events such as births, deaths, marriage, migration, or changes in financial conditions. These updates ensure that PSER remains a dynamic registry rather than a static dataset. 
Updated data will be used for re evaluating eligibility for social protection programs. This adaptive mechanism allows the government to maintain a near-real-time socio-economic profile of the population.

---

## *Chunk 10 — Communication Channels and Citizen Support*

PSER maintains multiple public communication channels to address citizen queries and share official information. Residents can access updates and announcements through the following platforms:

* *Instagram:* @pser.punjab https://www.instagram.com/pser.punjab/?hl=en
* *Facebook:* pser.punjab https://www.facebook.com/pser.punjab/
* *TikTok:* @pser.punjab https://www.tiktok.com/@pser.punjab

These channels publish survey progress updates, verification instructions, FAQs, grievance procedures, and privacy commitments.

---

## *Chunk 11 — Privacy, Security, and Ethical Safeguards*

PSER follows strong privacy and ethical protocols to protect household data. Enumerators are bound by confidentiality rules and cannot share or store data outside official systems. All survey responses are transmitted via encrypted channels. Access to the registry is restricted to authorized government departments strictly for welfare and planning purposes. Public awareness campaigns also highlight these safeguards to build trust. The government ensures that the PSER database is not used for political or commercial purposes, and all processes comply with provincial data governance guidelines.

## *Chunk 12 — High-Level Summary for Fast Retrieval*

The Punjab Socio-Economic Registry (PSER) is a province-wide door-to-door survey designed to collect accurate household data for social protection, led by PSPA with strategic oversight from the P&D Board and support from BoS, PITB, the Urban Unit, district administrations, and the CSU. It covers every district and uses a hybrid data collection model combining tablet-based interviews, administrative records, and community validation. A trained workforce of enumerators and monitors ensures data quality, supported by extensive public awareness campaigns. If an official PSER enumerator has visited your home and collected your information on a tablet, you are already registered, but you may confirm via the PSER helpline at 0800-02345. PSER is a dynamic registry that updates over time as households report life events, and citizens can follow official updates through PSER’s verified social media channels. Strong privacy and security safeguards ensure that all data is encrypted, confidential, and used only for welfare planning.

*Chunk 13 - BISP and PSER* 
PSER is different from BISP. PSER is a province-wide survey to collect accurate household data for social protection in Punjab, while BISP (Benazir Income Support Program) is a federal cash transfer program aimed at providing financial assistance to eligible individuals across Pakistan. Registering in PSER will not effect your funds coming from BISP.
